This project is a homage to the classic game Bomberman, developed using Pygame as part of a computer programming introduction course. It adheres to specific evaluation criteria, notably abstaining from direct object-oriented programming (OOP) features. Instead of
employing classes, all entities are controlled through lists and variables. Furthermore, iterative loops, apart from the primary "While True loop," are replaced with recursion to manage each loop operation individually. For a detailed explanation of the code, you can
refer to the following video:

(To execute the game, please ensure you have installed the Pygame library. Then, navigate to the game folder using your preferred interpreter and execute the "main.py" file. This will launch the game seamlessly.)
